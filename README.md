This application looks for the Roblox window, waits for it to become visible & changes the window title. That's it.
Why does this exist? I felt like it.

The code includes a small "debug mode"! If you rebuild the program with it enabled, the console will not close immediately & provides a little information on what's going on.

HOW TO USE
===
Start the application and open Roblox, or the other way around, both work.

BETTER WAY TO USE
===
If you have Bloxstrap installed, open Bloxstrap Menu

Then make an integration & put the path to the executable where it belongs. Now, every time you open Roblox, the program will run & change the title.
Cool, right?
